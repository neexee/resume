{\bf Job}
\begin{itemize}
  \item since 2015 -- \href{https://2gis.com}{2GIS}. Python, C++, Go, Scala. Working on:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item CDN delivering updates in map data to 20 millions of mobile users. Converted CDN-controlling CLI application to a huge RESTful API. It allowed us to automate internal processes and deliver faster and better updates for users. I was working on code quality and performance a lot, it's written in Python.
    \item Business statistics pipeline handling 20 thousands messages per second with ease. Helped my team to build fault-tolerant cross datacenter system based on Kafka. It replaced the old ZeroMQ-based system which couldn't work in geodistributed mode.
    \item Search backend for online version of 2GIS. Designed JSON-based RESTful API to replace Apache Thrift API. Did some heavy lifting using templates in C++.
    \item Geopositioning service. Brought a new life to the dying Python service. It was slow and hard to scale. In the first iteration I rewrote it using asyncio, it could handle 3000 rps. In the second iteration I rewrote it in Go, it could handle these 3000 rps without any special requiremens to a hardware.
  \end{itemize}

  \item since 2017 -- \href{http://fit.nsu.ru/}{Novosibirsk State University}. Teaching:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Operating systems
    \item Parallel programming
    \item Computing history
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

{\bf Education}
\begin{itemize}
  \item 2009 -- 2015. \href{https://www.nsu.ru/n/}{Novosibirsk State University}. Master's degree in Information Technology.
\end{itemize}

{\bf Languages}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Python}. My main workhorse. I love to write tests using pytest. I love to check types with mypy. I'm sceptical about ORM, but sqlalchemy is not bad.
\item \textit{C++}. I understand most of the ``Effective Modern C++'' but my skills a little bit rusty. There's an example of \href{https://github.com/neexee/review}{my code}.
\item \textit{Go}. It's a pretty good language if you need a DSL for a network application or a small and fast CLI application. I've wrote several services using it. It was especially pleasant to re-write the old Python service in Go.
\item \textit{Scala}. I love Apache Kafka, but Go and C++ connectors for it are not as good as their JVM-based counterparts. Scala is native language for Kafka. So I've wrote and supported several services using Scala just for the sake of their quality. I know a little bit about functional programming, it helps to write readable code from time to time.
\end{itemize}

{\bf What I like}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Learning}. Lifelong learner. The \href{https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/43338630-sergey-machulskis?shelf=professional}{list of books} I've read.
\item \textit{GNU/Linux}. Happy Gentoo/Ubuntu user for a decade. I know enough about UNIX-like OSs to teach it at the university.
\item \textit{Distributed systems}. I appreciate the motto ``Reliability, Maintainability, Scalability!''. ``Designing Data-Intensive Applications''-level of understanding. Can explain what's happening in tcpdump + wireshark, Zookeeper and WALs.
\item \textit{Documentation}. I'm trying hard to explain complex things in a simple manner. Did deep research on this topic.
\item \textit{UX}. I consider myself as a backend programmer just because I don't like GUIs. But I care deeply about UX.
\item \textit{Databases}. There's a list I'm happy to discuss and use: \textit{Redis}, \textit{Tarantool} \textit{PostgreSQL} and \textit{ClickHouse}.
\item \textit{Git}. I've been preparing releases with dozens of branches for years. I wrote \href{https://github.com/neexee/review/tree/master/components/Git}{a wrapper} around libgit2.
\item \textit{Virtualization}. Docker and LXD are not new words to me. Had some brief encounters with OpenStack and k8s.
\item \textit{Easy deploy}. I was using Ansible, it's not bad. It would be nice to try something else.
\item \textit{Monitoring}. Grafana, Zabbix, triggers, SLAs. It's not an afterthought for me.
